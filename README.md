# HashSumChecker

Planned Enhancements:
1 - Ensure better error checking if not all information is provided by user to compute hash sums
2 - Allow user to drag and drop a hash sum to compare the file to


Version 1.0

Allows user to browse for a file or drag and drop a file, paste the provided hashsum, calculate the hashsum of the file, 
and then compares it to the provided hash sum.

Uses PyQt5 for the GUI and does shell commands to compute hash sums. Works on MacOS, tested on MacOS Catalina (10.15)
